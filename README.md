Moeraki Kemu Web Frontend
---------

This is a web frontend for my implementation of the board game Moeraki Kemu that you can find [here](https://github.com/etgramli/Moeraki_Kemu).
The linked project has to be exported as executable jar (i.e. by eclipse) to be used in this project.

The web ui is achieved with the Play framework.
