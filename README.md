Moeraki Kemu Web Frontend
---------

This is a web frontend for my implementation of the board game Moeraki Kemu that you can find [here](https://github.com/etgramli/Moeraki_Kemu).
The linked project has to be exported as executable jar (i.e. by eclipse) to be used in this project.

The web ui is achieved with the Play framework, JavaScript and AJAX to communicate with the existing controller that handles the game logic.
